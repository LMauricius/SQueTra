# SQueTra
A modern C++ **s**cene **que**ry **tra**nsformation library.

# Good stuff about it
- Header only
- Simple to use templates
- C++20 concepts for safe and clear code
- Completely modular and extensible
- Simple to setup and use, (almost) fully documented code


# Installing
Currently CMake install doesn't copy headers, 
so just copy the `include/dynasma` folder to your favourite include location.
